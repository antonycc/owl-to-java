# owl-to-java

OWL to Java generates a Java class model from an ontology defined using the W3C Web Ontology Language (OWL). The models are built by taking a specified list of OWL classes and creating Java classes for those OWL classes and their properties.

Mission statement: Be a useful bridge between ontologies defned using open standards and object models of immediate practical use in applications
