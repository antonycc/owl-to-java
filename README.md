# owl-to-java

OWL to Java generates a Java class model from an ontology defined using the W3C Web Ontology Language (OWL).
The models are built by taking a specified list of OWL classes and creating Java classes for those OWL classes
and their properties.

Mission statement: Be a useful bridge between ontologies defined using open standards and object models of immediate
practical use in applications 

# Done

OWL to Java currently:
* Includes Java class mappings to OWL and RDF elements.
* Parses an OWL ontology into a map of java classes.
* Generates Java source from an OWL ontology in a local file.
* Runs as a Gradle Task
* Creates Java Source that doesn't yet compile

# Bugs

* Dependency org.simpleframework:simple-xml:2.7.1 is vulnerable
```text
CVE-2017-1000190 9.1 Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference vulnerability pending CVSS allocation
Results powered by Checkmarx(c)
```
* :jar: No valid plugin descriptors were found in META-INF/gradle-plugins

# TODO

* Separate project with ready to use Schema.org library Jar
* Sort fields in alphabetical order
* Gradle Examples
* Graph DB annotations + graph example
* Graphical viewer + example
* Versioning policy, auto-increment and release.
* License dependency extraction
* Customise POM with licence: https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/publishing_maven.html
* Consider progress against GitHub badges e.g. https://github.com/detekt/detekt
See: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24827733/how-do-you-set-the-maven-artifact-id-of-a-gradle-project
* Build with Java 18
* **Publish: Release 1.0.0 to GitHub packages**
* KDoc for code
* Java Docs for output
* Public website
* Publish Detekt and Kover reports from the Quality Report Build
* Consider progress against additional GitHub README badges.
* GitHub and public website analytics
* Donate option (linked to hosting account)
* Automate library updates
* Contributor guidelines
* **Library Launch: Release to Maven Central**
* Command-line execution from a shaded Jar
* RDBMS annotations + relational example
* Command line Examples
* Command-line execution from a Docker container
* Release to DockerHub
* HATEOAS REST API
* API docs with runnable swagger
* REST API examples
* Text based viewer
* Examples that scrape groups of sites using something like https://github.com/creative-mines/schemaorg4j
* Dashboard for Person data showing demographics and interpersonal connections
* **Platform Launch: API based generation and viewer**
* Kotlin idioms
* Profiling
* Inheritance by interface (via Lombok, or better in Kotlin?) and aggregation
* Handling of plurals as collections e.g. Person.parent is a relationship with multiplicity
* Load configuration set by name e.g. (com.example.OwlToJavaConfigSetSchemaOrg.setTaskConfig(this))
* Load configuration from Kotlin Script: https://kotlinexpertise.com/run-kotlin-scripts-from-kotlin-programs/
* Extend one schema with another
* @since versioned annotation on tests and auto-generated version history from test annotations



Example of Kotlin script evaluation
```kotlin
val script = compile("""listOf(1,2,3).joinToString(":")""")
assertEquals(listOf(1, 2, 3).joinToString(":"), script.eval())

val regenerate by registering(RegenerateOntologyTask::class) {
    compile(File(Paths.get("${projectDir}/owl2java-schema.org.config").absolutePath()).load()).eval(this)
}
```

# See also

* Class and field definitions are generated based on OWL https://www.w3.org/TR/owl-guide/
* The ontology from https://schema.org/ is the primary use case for this project.

# Examples:

Build with tests which generate Java Sources:
```shell
 % gradle clean test                                                       
Starting a Gradle Daemon, 2 incompatible Daemons could not be reused, use --status for details

> Configure project :
WARNING: Unsupported Kotlin plugin version.
The `embedded-kotlin` and `kotlin-dsl` plugins rely on features of Kotlin `1.5.31` that might work differently than in the requested version `1.7.0-RC2`.

# Contributions

Owl to Java uses Trunk based Development https://www.flagship.io/git-branching-strategies/#trunk-based-development

An alternate branching strategy is likely to be required when there are multiple committers. While a low volume of
commits and committers remains we have two **paths to contribute to this project**:
* Contact me via my GitHub profile (->website -> LinkedIn) and ask to be added to this project.
* Fork the repository then create a pull request.

## Request a feature

To request a new feature:
1. Add an item to the TODO list

(see above for **paths to contribute to this project**).

## Add a feature

To add a new feature:
1. Pick a feature from this `README.md`
2. Create at least one test for the feature, cut and paste the TODO list item into the test comment
3. Build using `gradle build`
4. Commit code which passes `gradle clean check -PsafeBuildMode=false`
5. Get the commit hash using `git rev-parse HEAD` and add it to the test KDoc.

e.g.
```kotlin
    /**
     *  Support all classes as the default
     *  @since("Commit hash: e66cfd2dedd09bb496ac852a630ee1fb62466533")
     */
    @Test
